            <h1>Sam Falberg's Portfolio Palooza</h1>
            <p>My name is Sam and this is my portfolio. Here you will learn the ins and outs of my savage mind. However, if that seems unappealing, 
                I have a wealth of cantankerous cat pictures sure to tickle your fancy.</p>
            
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am currently studying computer science at the University of Colorado at Boulder. 
                Two years ago, I attended the Computer Science Summer Institute in Chicago, where I helped build a webapp that lets the user search through a database of charities.
                However I'm pretty rusty with HTML and Javascript skills so I'm excited to be part of the STEP internship to get back into the swing of things.
                <br>Here are some other facts about me:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I can play the drums, bass, and guitar</li>
                    <li>I'm legally blind in my right eye</li>
                    <li>I think spiders are cute</li>
                </ul>    
            
            <p>When I was 4 years old, I called 911 on a payphone because I thought it wouldn't work without me putting any coins in. I was wrong. 
                <br>I was at a public pool at the time and a police officer actually showed up. Luckily, this was right as I was leaving with my mom, so I was never caught. 
                Sometimes I wonder if the cops are still looking for me.
                <br>As I mentioned before, you may find this story boring. So, for suffering through it, here's a picture of a cat going through a rough patch in its life:</p>
