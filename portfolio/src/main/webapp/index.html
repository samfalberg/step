      <h1>Sam Falberg's Portfolio Palooza</h1>
      <p>My name is Sam and this is my portfolio. Here you will learn the ins and outs of my savage mind. However, if that seems unappealing, 
          I have a wealth of cantankerous cat pictures sure to tickle your fancy.</p>
      
      <h2>About me (Sam (in case you forgot who this portfolio is about (just checking)))</h2>
      <p>When I was 4 years old, I called 911 on a payphone because I thought it wouldn't work without me putting any coins in. I was wrong. 
          <br>I was at a public pool at the time and a police officer actually showed up. Luckily, this was right as I was leaving with my mom, so I was never caught. 
          Sometimes I wonder if the cops are still looking for me.
          <br>As I mentioned before, you may find this story boring. So, for suffering through it, here's a picture of a cat going through a rough patch in its life:</p>
